# Splitter
Split big audio files into smaller ones.

Uses ffmpeg. Only works with mp3 files at the moment.

Simply because I had a few monolithic audio book files which I wanted split up into smaller chunks for the audio book app on my phone.

Intel Mac only at the moment.

There's the source code, and if you just want the compiled version there's the zip file of the disk image available:

[Splitter install disk image](Splitter.dmg.zip)
