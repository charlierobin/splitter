# Splitter
Split big audio files into smaller ones.

Uses FFmpeg.

Opens mp3, m4a, aiff, wav, mp4 and m4b files.

Simply because I had a few monolithic audio book files which I wanted split up into smaller chunks for the audio book app on my phone.

Intel Mac only at the moment.

There's the source code, and if you just want the compiled version there's the zip file of the disk image available:

[Splitter install disk image](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/jbkmn3dsuvrulcz/Splitter.dmg.zip?dl=0)

If you want to tinker and then build from the source code, you'll need to have a version of the FFmpeg command line binary in the “ffmpeg” directory for Xojo to use during the build process.
